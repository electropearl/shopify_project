# shopify_project

Fall 2022 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question
This application was made using Flutter/dart and Cloud Firestore as a database.

This project will allow you to create, update, delete, and view inventory items. 
This project also has the ability to create new warehouse locations and to assign inventory to the different locations.

To create, delete, or update an item press the icon on the top left of the home page. (Shopping Bag Icon)

Add - Will allow you to create an item
Delete - will allow you to delete an item
Update - will allow you to update an item, select the item using drop down to edit it.

To create a new warehouse press the icon on the top right of the home page. (Warehouse Icon)

Create Warehouse - Allows you to create a ware house and take input for fields

There is a feed that will show the items. If you click on the icon it will show more info about the item.

#Bugs
After testing there is a bug with the delete function where it will show a error on the screen. If you blink you will miss it. A solution might be to have a loading screen. The bug it minimal and is not fatal.
